# Breast Cancer Classifier

This repository contains machine learning models for classifying breast cancer using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.

## Dataset

The [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer+wisconsin+(diagnostic)) is a widely used dataset for breast cancer classification. It consists of features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The features describe various characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The task is to predict whether the breast mass is benign or malignant.

## Decision Tree Classifier

The Decision Tree Classifier model in this repository uses a decision tree algorithm to classify breast cancer cases. It builds a tree-like model of decisions and their possible consequences. Decision trees are easy to interpret and can handle both numerical and categorical data.

### Usage

To use the Decision Tree Classifier model:

1. Install the required libraries.
2. Run the `decision_tree_classifier.ipynb` script.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the script to load and train the model, make predictions, and evaluate its performance.

## Logistic Regression Model

The Logistic Regression Model in this repository uses the logistic regression algorithm to classify breast cancer cases. It models the probability of the presence of a particular class using a logistic function. Logistic regression is a popular algorithm for binary classification tasks.

### Usage

To use the Logistic Regression Model:

1. Install the required libraries.
2. Run the `logistic_regression_model.ipynb` script.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the script to load and train the model, make predictions, and evaluate its performance.
